            <p> Based off my critque, I was able to make a starry background by using a gif which is super exciting.
                I also had feed back to give a description of what the picture is of, but sadly
                the NASA API didn't include exactly what we are looking at. One of my favorite
                take aways is playing with a websites background and learning how to use API's to
                generate photo's. I never have has a background implemented in CSS, let alone a backgrounf that moves.
                It's also cool to see how simple it is to use API's with photos, just need the img url. 
                Overall, I personally feel I hit my goals, I just wish I could make it more
                visually stimulating. I did get feedback to make the buttons more intresting so I plan on changing that.

            <p> I have the NASA API working, where based off the rover you choose, a picture the rover has taken
                will appear with the date it was taken. Along with that you can regenerate pictures and go back to 
                the home screen to go to choose a different rover. One of the things to know about choosing the rover
                and seeing it's pictures is that Spirit and Opportunity only have 6 pictures, while Curiosity has around
                850 pictures. So I if you want to see more of a variety choose Curiosity.

            <p>For my progress I have started the website. 
                I’ve got the home screen basically done, and I’ve been experimenting with adding a picture as a background. 
                I added a drop down menu to select a rover. 
                My next big step is figuring out the API to generate rover pictures and then to style that page. 
                I wanted to make the background more exciting and I’ve been getting close to figuring that out.

            <p> The theme of the website is rovers. I’m making a website that has a NASA API. The website will have a drop down menu of rovers to choose from, and based on the rover you will see a picture it took and the date it took it. You can regenerate images and choose other rovers. My inspiration is I love space and I remember when curiosity the rover landed on Mars. I want the general public to feel connected with the excitement of space exploration. My audience would be the general public, specifically people who are interested in space exploration.

                I want to try to rely on JS for the designing of the website. I’ve never been exposed to different packages so it’ll be a challenge but very useful to learn. 
                
                I want to look into the NASA Mars Rover Pictures API, if it doesn’t work out I plan on exploring other APIs. Maybe even change my topic to plant care. 
                
                I plan on making my webpage usable on iphones and desktops. So I need to make it responsive towards iphones. 
                
                I want to make it look pretty and cool, right now my wireframe is basic on what I want but I plan to expand it, like maybe having a moving star background would be a stretch goal.
