            <p> In this assignment I created a page that loads random dad jokes! Some problems I ran into is the button not working.
                I actually had this issue in the past so I remembered that I needed to let the contents of the page load. I fixed
                the issue by using "document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {". I also haven't used API's in 
                a while so I found this helpful youtube video that explains how everything works. I finally added a little
                css to practice and make the page look pretty.

            <p> In this assignment I had to go through given code and fix the bugs. There was some very hidden mistakes
                that I had a hard time finding as simple as "quaz()" instead of "quiz()". But after some time and refreshing
                myself of on some Javascript I was able to figure out the bugs.

            <p> In this assignment I got the opportunity to play around with the input tags, button tags, progress tag and text area tag.
                Personally I had never used input tags or progress tags before and I really enjoyed learning about them.
                Along with that, I stumbled upon the label tag which is super easy to use and helps with labeling
                my site. Some struggles was how to not have the page refresh when I click the "Click Me For Your Score"
                button and recongizing that I needed the DOMContentLoaded before diving into code.

            <p> In this assignment I changed CSS properties using DOM. 
                Along with that I manipulated DOM properties and used event listeners!
                What I mostly struggled with was CSS in general, but I really enjoyed playing with the 
                event listeners. I learned about the different things you can use event listeners for.

            <p>This is just the basic skeleton of my Class Portal. 
                My plan is to clean it up and make it better. Personally I struggled with making it responsive and flex is something I am still working on mastering.
                I also wanted to make a cute plant theme, so trying to get the image where I wanted and also be responsive was a struggle. It took alot of problem solving
                and playing around with it. I plan on researching more about making my websote responsive and flex. This assignment will most likley have a many more updates to come.
