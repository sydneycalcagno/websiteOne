            <p>This is just the basic skeleton of my Class Portal. 
                My plan is to clean it up and make it better. Personally I struggled with making it responsive and flex is something I am still working on mastering.
                I also wanted to make a cute plant theme, so trying to get the image where I wanted and also be responsive was a struggle. It took alot of problem solving
                and playing around with it. I plan on researching more about making my websote responsive and flex. This assignment will most likley have a many more updates to come.
