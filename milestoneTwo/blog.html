            <p> In this assignment I got to run REACT. I did use the pre-made button counter by REACT and decided to 
                make it my own. I put a cute picture of a plant on there and changed what the button was saying.

                <p>FilterableAssignmentTable is the parent, in other words the entire thing.
                    The AssignmentTable is a sub of the entire program where it contains all
                    the information about the assignments, while the SearchBar is not a part
                    of the AssignmentTable. The SearchBar will be used to look up a specific
                    assignment. AssignmentCategoryRow splits between the Homeworks and 
                    Projects, and properly shows/contains the respected assignment. 
                    AssignmentRow will have the assignment and have a date assigned to it. 
                    The AssignmentRow will have assignments, if the assignment is green, then 
                    it is completed, if it’s black it needs to be done.

                    AssignmentCategoryRow takes information from Assignment hw or project
                    state, so not a state.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p> 
                    Our single page application (SPA) is to be a fun trivia game that gives the player 
                    different trivia questions within different categories. The inspiration for this SPA
                     is the game Trivia Crack that became extremely popular around 2014. In Trivia Crack 
                     players would spin the wheel to get the question category, if they got the question 
                     correct they would get to spin the wheel for a new question. The goal was to get a 
                     character, which was a symbol of category mastery, before the other person. Our website
                      will draw similar features from this game. We intend to have different question 
                      categories and present the user with different types of trivia questions. Our website
                      will be different in key ways as ours is going to be single player and track overall 
                      success/progress instead of collecting icons. Our audience will most likely be ages
                       16-35 as we intend to find an API that has cultural trivia meant for young adults and teens.

                <p> 
                    For this project we are going to use a trivia API to generate all of the questions.
                     The API that we chose is Open Trivia Database. This API is free and does not require an 
                     API key or account. This API also allows us to pull more than just the question and answer,
                      it has other false answer options, a difficulty level and a category. This will allow us
                       to potentially track the “expert” level of the player as well.<br>

                <p> 
                    My contribution will be to help create components through REACT, 
                    and help out with the design of the website. Once we start, it will 
                    clear up the different things everyone will need to contribute. Overall 
                    we all are very flexible and plan to communicate what we need to do to 
                    complete this project.

            <p> In this assignment I created a page that loads random dad jokes! Some problems I ran into is the button not working.
                I actually had this issue in the past so I remembered that I needed to let the contents of the page load. I fixed
                the issue by using "document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {". I also haven't used API's in 
                a while so I found this helpful youtube video that explains how everything works. I finally added a little
                css to practice and make the page look pretty.

            <p> In this assignment I had to go through given code and fix the bugs. There was some very hidden mistakes
                that I had a hard time finding as simple as "quaz()" instead of "quiz()". But after some time and refreshing
                myself of on some Javascript I was able to figure out the bugs.

            <p> In this assignment I got the opportunity to play around with the input tags, button tags, progress tag and text area tag.
                Personally I had never used input tags or progress tags before and I really enjoyed learning about them.
                Along with that, I stumbled upon the label tag which is super easy to use and helps with labeling
                my site. Some struggles was how to not have the page refresh when I click the "Click Me For Your Score"
                button and recongizing that I needed the DOMContentLoaded before diving into code.

            <p> In this assignment I changed CSS properties using DOM. 
                Along with that I manipulated DOM properties and used event listeners!
                What I mostly struggled with was CSS in general, but I really enjoyed playing with the 
                event listeners. I learned about the different things you can use event listeners for.

                My plan is to clean it up and make it better. Personally I struggled with making it responsive and flex is something I am still working on mastering.
                I also wanted to make a cute plant theme, so trying to get the image where I wanted and also be responsive was a struggle. It took alot of problem solving
                and playing around with it. I plan on researching more about making my websote responsive and flex. This assignment will most likley have a many more updates to come.
