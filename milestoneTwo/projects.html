            <p> The theme of the website is rovers. I’m making a website that has a NASA API. The website will have a drop down menu of rovers to choose from, and based on the rover you will see a picture it took and the date it took it. You can regenerate images and choose other rovers. My inspiration is I love space and I remember when curiosity the rover landed on Mars. I want the general public to feel connected with the excitement of space exploration. My audience would be the general public, specifically people who are interested in space exploration.

                I want to try to rely on JS for the designing of the website. I’ve never been exposed to different packages so it’ll be a challenge but very useful to learn. 
                
                I want to look into the NASA Mars Rover Pictures API, if it doesn’t work out I plan on exploring other APIs. Maybe even change my topic to plant care. 
                
                I plan on making my webpage usable on iphones and desktops. So I need to make it responsive towards iphones. 
                
                I want to make it look pretty and cool, right now my wireframe is basic on what I want but I plan to expand it, like maybe having a moving star background would be a stretch goal.
